               <h2>Our Mission</h2>
               <p>
                  Let's talk about some cool stuff in space! Hydrogen cyanide (HCN), acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), amidogen (NH<sub>2</sub>), hydroxide (OH), and water (H<sub>2</sub>O) are some of the important chemicals found in comets in our solar system. In 2018, we had a great chance to take a close look at one comet called 46P/Wirtanen. We used a special telescope called the iSHELL spectrograph at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility to figure out how much of these chemicals were in the comet. This can tell us if Wirtanen is a super active comet, producing more water than most.

               <h2>Some Backstory</h2>
               <p>
                  A long time ago, our sun formed from a big cloud of gas and dust. The leftover material in that cloud became all the things in our solar system like planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. Comets like Wirtanen gathered most of their material from this cloud, and so we expect the composition of those comets which have survived countless orbits around our sun to reflect the compositions and processes experienced at the time when the cometary nucleus formed.&dagger;
               </p>
               <p>
                  There are two main groups of comets in our solar system. One group, called Oort cloud comets (OOCs), formed far away from the sun, and the other group, called Jupiter-family comets (JFCs), formed closer in the Kuiper belt. By studying the ices in comet nuclei, we can learn about the early solar system from two different distances from the sun's center. JFCs have shorter orbits, so we can watch them closely as they come near the sun and the Earth much more frequently than OOCs ever do.
               </p>
               <p>
                  One of these JFCs is 46P/Wirtanen. It was a big deal for scientists, and it was supposed to be the target for a mission called Rosetta Lander, but that plan changed (the JFC comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, was selected instead&Dagger;). In 2018, Wirtanen came close to Earth, giving us a unique chance to gather data about its chemicals and how they're distributed.

               <h2>Observation Results</h2>
               <p>
                  The data about these molecules (HCN, H<sub>2</sub>O, OH, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, and NH<sub>2</sub>) can help us understand where Wirtanen fits among other comets. This makes our collection of data about comets in the inner solar system even better and shows that Wirtanen is probably more active than most comets. We had great opportunities to observe Wirtanen in 2018, both before and after its closest approach to the sun. The info we've gathered will mix with data from other observations in December 2018 and January and February 2019 to give us a dynamic look at a comet in motion in our solar system.

                  Data for this study were obtained at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF), operated by the University of Hawaii under contract NNH14CK55B with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). We are most fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct observations from Maunakea and recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of Maunakea has always had within the indigenous Hawaiian community. We acknowledge the commitment of NASA-IRTF to comet 46P/Wirtanen ºs observing campaign in its 2018 historical apparition. This study was generously funded by the NASA Planetary Astronomy/Solar System Observations (NNX12AG24G, 15-SSO15_2-0028, 18-SSO18_2-0040), Planetary Atmospheres (NNX12AG60G) and Solar System Workings Programs (NNX17AC86G), the NASA Astrobiology Institute (13-13NAI7_2_0032), the NASA Emerging Worlds Program (NNN12AA01C and 80NSSC20K0341), the National Science Foundation (AST-1616306, AST-1615441), NASA Headquarters under the NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship Program (grant NNX16AP49H). We thank an anonymous reviewer for suggestions that improved the paper. We acknowledge and thank the entire staff at IRTF for their support during our observations. We would also like to give additional acknowledgement to several of our colleagues, including Kyra Chappell, Danielle Gibbs, Younas Khan, Mohammad Saki, Evan Schmitz, and especially to Dr. Erika Gibb for providing assistance and support throughout the data reduction process and writing of the paper.
